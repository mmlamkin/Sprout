'name': "Lettuce",
'description': "This is a half-hardy vegetable that you can keep growing all season long by planting one small crop at a time. Days to maturity tend to be short. Garden lettuce is far superior, in both taste and vitamin A content, to supermarket brands.",
"optimal_sun": "Part Sun",
"optimal_soil": "Loamy",
"planting_considerations": "Consider planting rows of chives or garlic between your lettuce to control aphids. They act as “barrier plants” for the lettuce. Planning your garden so that lettuce will be in the shade of taller plants, such as tomatoes or sweet corn, in the heat of the summer, may reduce bolting as well.",
"when_to_plant": "Lettuce is a cool-season crop that grows well in the spring and fall in most areas. Lettuce seedlings will even tolerate a light frost. 45-65°F is the ideal temperature. Start seeds indoors 4 to 6 weeks before last spring frost date for earliest crop. Direct sowing is recommended as soon as the ground can be worked. Snow won’t hurt them, but a desiccating cold wind will. Harden off seedlings for about one week, and transplant outside between 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after last spring frost.",
"growing_from_seed": "Plant seeds ½ inch deep.",
"transplanting": "Leaf lettuce: Plant 4 inches apart. Cos and loose-headed types: Plant 8 inches apart. Firm-headed types: Plant 16 inches apart.",
"spacing": "Final spacing for Cos and loose-headed types should be 8 inches in all directions and 16 inches for firm-headed types.",
"watering": "Make sure soil remains moist but is well-drained. Lettuce will tell you when it needs water. Just look at it. If the leaves are wilting, sprinkle them anytime—even in the heat of the day—to cool them off and slow down the transpiration rate.",
"feeding": "n/a",
"other_care": "You should be able to sow additional seeds every two weeks for a continuous harvest throughout the growing season.",
"diseases": "White Mold",
"pests": "Aphids, Earwigs",
"harvesting": "Lettuce should be harvested when full size, but just before maturity. You want it young and tender. Before maturity, you can harvest leaf lettuce by simply removing outer leaves so that the center leaves can continue to grow. Butterhead or romaine types can be harvested by removing the outer leaves, digging up the whole plant or cutting the plant about an inch above the soil surface. A second harvest is often possible this way. Crisphead lettuce is picked when the center is firm. It’s best to harvest in the morning before leaves have been exposed to sun.",

name: "Carrots",
description: "Carrots are a popular root vegetable that are easy to grow in sandy soil. They are resistant to most pests and diseases, and are a good late season crop that can tolerate frost. Not all carrots are orange; varieties vary in color from purple to white.",
optimal_sun: "Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day)",
optimal_soil: "Sandy, Neutral pH",
planting_considerations: "Carrots are biennial plants. If you leave them in the ground, the tops will flower and produce seeds the second year.",
when_to_plant: "Plan to plant seeds outdoors 3 to 5 weeks before the last spring frost date.",
growing_from_seed: "Plant seeds 3-4 inches apart in rows. Rows should be at least a foot apart.",
transplanting: "Transplanting carrots is not recommended.",
spacing: "Final spacing should be 3-4 inches in all directions.",
watering: "Water at least one inch per week.",
feeding: "n/a",
other_care: "Gently mulch to retain moisture, speed germination and block the sun from the roots. Soil should be well drained and loose to prevent forking and stunting of the root growth. Carrots taste much better after a couple of frosts. Following the first hard frost in the fall, cover carrot rows with an 18-inch layer of shredded leaves to preserve them for harvesting later.",
diseases: "Aster Yellow Disease will cause shortened and discolored carrot tops and hairy roots. This disease is spread by pests as they feed from plant to plant. Keep weeds down and invest in a control plan for pests such as leafhoppers. This disease has the ability to overwinter.",
pests: "Wireworms, Flea Beetles",
harvesting: "Carrots are mature at around 2 ½ months and ½ inch in diameter. You may harvest whenever desired maturity is reached. You may leave mature carrots in the soil for storage if the ground will not freeze.",
storage_use: "To store freshly harvested carrots, twist off the tops, scrub off the dirt under cold running water, let dry and seal in airtight plastic bags, and refrigerate. If you simply put fresh carrots in the refrigerator, they’ll go limp in a few hours.",

name: "Basil",
description: "Basil is a leafy, fragrant annual with a bushy appearance. The most common type of basil is sweet basil; other types include purple basil (less sweet than common basil), Lemon basil (lemon flavor), and Thai basil (licorice flavor). Basil is easy to grow and works well in Italian dishes, but it only grows in the summer, so plan accordingly.",
optimal_sun: "Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day)",
optimal_soil: "Loamy",
planting_considerations: "Tomatoes make great neighbors for basil plants in the garden. Ensure your outdoor site gets 6-8 hours of full sun daily; soil should be moist and well-drained.",
when_to_plant: "To get a head start, start the seeds indoors 6 weeks before the last spring frost. Plant the seeds/seedlings about 10 to 12 inches apart. After the last frost date, plant the seeds/seedlings in the ground. The soil should be around 70ºF for best growth.",
growing_from_seed: "After the last frost date, plant the seeds/seedlings in the ground about ¼-inch deep. Plant the seeds/seedlings about 10 to 12 inches apart.",
transplanting: "After the last frost date, plant the seeds/seedlings in the ground about ¼-inch deep. Plant the seeds/seedlings about 10 to 12 inches apart.",
spacing: "They should grow to about 12 to 24 inches in height. Final spacing should be 12-24 inches in all directions.",
watering: "Make sure soil remains moist but is well-drained.",
feeding: "n/a",
other_care: "Remember to pinch out the flower heads as soon as they appear to make sure that the leaves will continue growing.",
diseases: "Variety of bacterial and fungal leaf, stem, and root diseases",
pests: "Aphids",
harvesting: "After the seedlings have their first six leaves, prune to above the second set. Pinch or cut at the base lateral stems to harvest. The best time to harvest is right when the plant starts to bud (before the flowers bloom).",
storage_use: "The best method for storing basil is freezing. Freezing will prevent the plant from losing any of its flavor. To quick-freeze basil, dry whole sprigs of basil and package them in airtight plastic bags.",

name: "Broccoli",
description: "Broccoli is a cool-season crop that, like spinach, can be grown in the spring or fall. In fact, you may be able to get a continual harvest throughout both seasons if you time planting correctly. A member of the cabbage family, broccoli is rich in vitamins.",
optimal_sun: "Full Sun(at least 6 hours a day)",
optimal_soil: "Sandy, Mildly Acidic to Neutral pH",
planting_considerations: "n/a",
when_to_plant: "Broccoli can germinate in soil with temperatures as low as 40ºF. For spring plantings, seed or set transplants 2 to 3 weeks before last spring frost date. If you transplant, assume 10 less days for growth or the “days to maturity” on the seed packet. For fall plantings, seed 85 to 100 days before your average first fall frost. If you live in a warm climate, a fall planting is best, as broccoli thrives in cool weather. Plant seeds in mid- to late-summer in most places.",
growing_from_seed: "Broccoli requires full sun and moist, fertile soil that’s slightly acidic. Work in 2 to 4 inches of rich compost or a thin layer of compost before planting. Plant seeds ½ inch deep.",
transplanting: "Set transplants slightly deeper than they were grown originally.",
spacing: "Space plants 12 to 24 inches apart, depending on the side heads you want to harvest. If you overseed, you will need to thin seedlings to 12 inches apart to give room for the broccoli to grow.",
watering: "Provide consistent soil moisture with regular watering, especially in drought conditions. Some varieties of broccoli are heat tolerant, but all need moisture. Do not get developing heads wet when watering.",
feeding: "n/a",
other_care: "Roots are very shallow, do not cultivate. Suffocate weeds with mulch.",
diseases: "Downy mildew: Yellow patches on leaves are usually caused by moist weather. Keep leaves as dry as possible with good air circulation. Buy resistant varieties. Nitrogen deficiency: If the bottom leaves turn yellow and the problem continues toward the top of the plant, the plants need a high nitrogen (but low phosphorus) fertilizer or bloodmeal. Blood meal is a quick Nitrogen fix for yellowing leaves.",
pests: "Aphids: Curling leaves may mean that the plant’s sap is being sucked by insects. Apply soapy water to all sides of leaves whenever you see aphids. Cabbage loopers: Small holes on the leaves between the veins mean small green caterpillars are present. Look at the undersides of the leaves. Hand pick if the problem is small or control with Bacillus thuringiensis. Use a floating row cover just after planting through harvest to prevent caterpillars. Cabbageworms and other worm pests: Treat same as loopers.",
harvesting: "In terms of timing: Harvest broccoli when the buds of the head are firm and tight before the heads flower. If you see yellow petals, harvest immediately. For best taste, harvest in the morning before the soil heats up. Cut the stalk of the main head at a slant, about 5 to 8 inches below the head. Most varieties have side-shoots that will continue to develop after the main head is harvested. You can harvest from one plant for many weeks, in some cases, from spring to fall, if you’re summer isn’t too hot.",
